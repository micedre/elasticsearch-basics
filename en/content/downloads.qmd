### 5. Kibana Dashboards

Learn to visualize and explore your data with Kibana's powerful interface.

**Topics covered:**
- Kibana setup and installation
- Data exploration with Discover
- Kibana Query Language (KQL)
- Creating visualizations (line, bar, pie, metric, table)
- Building interactive dashboards
- Dashboard filters and controls

## Download All Notebooks

:::{.callout-tip}
## Bulk Download
You can download all notebooks at once by cloning the repository or using the rendered `_site/` directory after running `quarto render`.

```bash
# After rendering, notebooks are in the _site directory
quarto render
ls _site/*.ipynb
```
:::

---

## How to Use the Notebooks

### 1. Activate Virtual Environment

```bash
# From the project directory
source .venv/bin/activate  # Unix/macOS
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
```

### 2. Start Jupyter

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

This will open Jupyter in your browser.

### 3. Navigate to the Downloaded Notebook

Open the downloaded `.ipynb` file in Jupyter.

### 4. Ensure Elasticsearch is Running

Before executing cells, make sure your Elasticsearch instance is running:

```bash
# Check if Elasticsearch is responding
curl http://localhost:9200

# Or start with Docker
docker run -d --name elasticsearch -p 9200:9200 \
  -e "discovery.type=single-node" \
  -e "xpack.security.enabled=false" \
  docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:8.11.0
```

### 5. Run the Cells

Execute cells in order using:
- `Shift + Enter` to run a cell and move to the next
- `Ctrl + Enter` to run a cell and stay on it
- `Cell > Run All` to run all cells

---

## Customizing the Examples

All examples use `eval: false` by default, meaning they won't execute during rendering. In the notebooks, you can:

1. **Modify connection settings** to match your Elasticsearch instance
2. **Adjust index names** to avoid conflicts
3. **Experiment with queries** and see results in real-time
4. **Add your own code cells** to practice

### Example: Customizing the Connection

```python
# Default connection
es = Elasticsearch(['http://localhost:9200'])

# Custom connection (Elastic Cloud example)
es = Elasticsearch(
    cloud_id='your-deployment-id',
    basic_auth=('username', 'password')
)

# Custom connection (with TLS)
es = Elasticsearch(
    ['https://your-elasticsearch-host:9200'],
    basic_auth=('username', 'password'),
    ca_certs='/path/to/ca.crt'
)
```

## Tips for Learning

1. **Run examples in order** - Later examples build on earlier ones
2. **Experiment freely** - Modify queries and see what happens
3. **Check Elasticsearch** - Use `curl` or Kibana to verify changes
4. **Read error messages** - They often contain helpful debugging info
5. **Use test indices** - Create dedicated indices for practice

## Data Safety
The notebooks demonstrate deletion operations. Always use test data and indices when learning. Never run these examples against production data!

## Troubleshooting

### Notebooks Won't Open

Make sure Jupyter is installed:

```bash
uv sync  # Installs all dependencies including Jupyter
```

### Connection Errors

Verify Elasticsearch is running and accessible:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9200
# Should return JSON with cluster information
```

### Import Errors

Ensure the virtual environment is activated and dependencies are installed:

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```
